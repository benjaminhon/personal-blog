To the <em>naturalist</em>, human beings are but biological machines. Free will is but <em>illusory</em> and moral values are but socio-biologically evolved behaviours for thriving. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“You can do what you decide to do — but you cannot decide what you will decide to do.” </p>\n<p>Sam Harris, Free Will</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Naturalists argue that because our <strong>sense of morality</strong> is a product of evolution, it is illusory. However, this argument clearly commits the <strong>genetic fallacy</strong>. Notice the absurdity by substituting 'sense of morality' for 'sense of sight'. It is absurd to say that because our <strong>sense of sight</strong> is a product of evolution, thus it is illusory and the things we observe is not real!</p>\n<p>Thus the theist may argue that though our <strong>sense of morality</strong> may have been a product of evolution, it allows us to navigate the spiritual world, just as our eyes navigate the physical world.</p>\n<h2>Is Naturalism Self Defeating?</h2>\n<hr>\n<p>Naturalism itself also looks to be self defeating. For how can our cognitive faculties, being formed by a process of random mutations and natural selection, be relied on to make metaphysically true statements such as \"only natural laws and forces operate in the world\"? At least the creationist believes that his God given brain is functioning properly, but the naturalist cannot know for sure.</p>\n<h2>How to Live as a Naturalist?</h2>\n<hr>\n<p>The naturalist should realise that whenever someone does him \"wrong\", it is no different than a rock falling on his toe. It is meaningless for the naturalist to argue what \"ought\" or \"ought not\" be done to him, for he knows there is no obligation for the other party other than the obligation to survive or not be caught. The naturalist should realise that he can make no \"right\" or \"wrong\" judgements on anyone for any action. For without an objective standard, who is to say what is \"right\" or \"wrong\"? </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>... there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil, no good, nothing but pitiless indifference ... We are machines for propagating DNA ... it is every living object's sole reason for being.</p>\n<p>Richard Dawkins</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The problem with naturalism, ironically, is that it is unnatural and goes against our experience of morality. Even the naturalist finds it hard to act on his beliefs.</p>\n<h2>Divine Command Theory</h2>\n<hr>\n<p>In <strong>divine command</strong> theory, the origin of the universe is a personal moral being, thus, providing an objective metaphysical foundation for our sense of morality. Divine command theory explains why we have our sense of morality and why we ought to follow it. If such a foundation does not exist, then our sense of morality is merely subjective, non obligatory and illusory. In other words, if God does not exist, then objective moral values do not exist.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If theism is false, why think that human beings have objective moral value? After all, on the naturalistic view, there's nothing special about human beings. They're just accidental byproducts of nature which have evolved relatively recently on an infinitesimal speck of dust called the planet Earth, lost somwehere in a hostile and mindless universe, and which are doomed to perish individually and collectively in a relatively short time</p>\n<p>William Lane Craig, Reasonable Faith: Christian Truth and Apologetics</p>\n</blockquote>"}},{"node":{"id":"992956eb-2abf-50f3-b5a7-7bb7ad171684","fields":{"path":"/philosophy/2016-8-28-lunatic-devil-god/","date":1472313600},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lunatic, Devil of Hell or Son of God","tags":["philosophy"]},"html":"<h2>Read John 8-10</h2>\n<hr>\n<html>\n<biblia:bible \n  layout=\"minimal\" \n  resource=\"esv\" \n  width=\"100%\" \n  height=\"500\" \n  historyButtons=\"false\" \n  navigationBox=\"false\" \n  resourcePicker=\"false\" \n  shareButton=\"false\" \n  textSizeButton=\"false\" \n  startingReference=\"John 8\">\n</biblia:bible>\n</html>\n<h2>Outrageous Claims</h2>\n<hr>\n<p>Jesus' claims about himself were astounding: <strong>He was both God and Saviour of Man</strong>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>He is the light of the world (John 8:12, John 9:5)</li>\n<li>He is from heaven (John 8:23)</li>\n<li>He is able to free men from sin (John 8:34-36)</li>\n<li>He gives eternal life (John 8:51, John 10:10)</li>\n<li>God is his Father (John 8:54)</li>\n<li>He is in nature, God (John 8:58, John 10:33.

Perhaps he was demon possessed (John 8:48, John 8:52) or a lunatic (John 10:19-21)? But could a lunatic amass such a following as Jesus did (John 8:30, John 10:42)? His enemies tried to argue that he was no friend of their faith (John 9:16). Those he healed thought that he was a prophet (John 9:17). Others who were awaiting the fulfillment of prophecy wondered if he was the Messiah (John 10:24). Religious fanatics tried to stone him for blasphemy (John 8:59, John 10:31-33).</p>\n<p>As expected, the reactions to Jesus' claims were extreme. People either believed his divinity (as unbelievable as it sounds) or they thought he was crazy and tried to kill him. </p>\n<h2>Moral Teacher?</h2>\n<hr>\n<p>There is a somewhat popular view of who Jesus was: <strong>He was merely a good man and moral teacher</strong> (John 7:12). This view seems to ignore the teachings of the man and his life's mission. To this, C. S. Lewis correctly retorts:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept his claim to be God. That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic - on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg - or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.</p>\n<p>C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity</p>\n</blockquote>"}}]}},"pageContext":{}}}
