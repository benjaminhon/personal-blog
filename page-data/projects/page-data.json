Achieved a sample time of 31250 Hz per channel using 64 single ended op-amps, 4 differential op-amps, 5 multiplexers and 1 CPLD. A unique multiplexing solution was used to mimic 64 instrumentation amplifiers, using only 4 differential op-amps instead of 64.</p>\n<h2>Files</h2>\n<p>Feel free to download my <a href=\"/personal-blog/assets/64-channel-neural-recorder/thesis.pdf\">thesis</a> and <a href=\"/personal-blog/assets/64-channel-neural-recorder/technical_report.pdf\">technical_report</a>.
