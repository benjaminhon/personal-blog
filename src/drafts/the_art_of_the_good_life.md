**Mental Accounting, The Fine Art of Correction, The Pledge, Black Box Thinking, Counterproductivity**.  

Living a good life has a lot to do with interpreting the facts in a constructive way. You can't nullify the loss of time and money, but you can reinterpret it. You're basically already dead, and everything else that follows is a gift.

We overestimate the role of the set-up and underestimate the role of correction. The good life is only achieved through constant readjustment. We are reluctant to adjustment because we view it as a flaw in the plan. It's not about having a fixed plan, but about repeated planning - an ongoing process. There is no perfect business strategy, no one right job. We begin with one set-up and then constantly adjust it, the more complicated the world has become, the less important the starting point is. Revise and correct the things that aren't quite working - swiftly and without feeling guilty.

A pledge is made by an individual, to abandon the freedom of choice and to limit one's options intentionally. When it comes to important issues, flexibility is not an advantage - it is a trap. Use radical inflexibility to reach long term goals that would be unrealizable if one is to be more flexible. Flexibility leads to decision fatigue, causing us to make the worst possible decisions. By being consistent on certain topics, you signal where you stand, and where there is no room for negotiation, making yourself less vulnerable to attack. Flexibility makes you unhappy and tired, and it distracts you from your goals. It is easier to stick to your pledges 100% of the time rather than 99%.

Make every false step improve your life. Everything we know in aviation is because someone somewhere died. Human beings are the opposite of the aviation industry, we are not retrospective. Very few people simply accept reality and analyze their flight recorders. We need to accept reality, all the more when it is not what we like. Self deception is incompatible with the good life. Take seriously the judgement of others. Build your own black box, with every wrong decision, take a look at your flight recorder and analyze what went wrong. Finally you need to rectify your mistakes, don't wait for the consequences to unfold, fix it while it is still fixable.

Many seem-to-be conveniences (especially technological) turn out to be time wasters. For example, after calculating the effective time savings of owning a car (number of hours you have to work to own one, insurance, mantainance, parking, etc ...), its average speed is slower than walking. Powerpoint slides in presentations has become one of the most counterproductive tools, wasting much time on beautifying slides animations and fonts instead of concentrating on the content of the presentation. Be on your guard against counterproductivity, if it doesn't genuinely contribute something, you can do without it.
