Argument From Motion
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Objects are in motion
2. Everything in motion was put into motion by something else
3. There can't be an infinite regress of movers
4. So there must be a first mover, itself unmoved, and that is God

Argument From Causation
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Some things are caused
2. Anything that's caused has to be caused by something else
3. There can't be an infinite regress of causes
4. So there must have been a first causer, itself uncaused, and that is God

Argument From Contingency
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Contingent Being = Any being that could have not existed
Necessary Being = A being that has always existed, that always will exist, and that can't not exist

We can't have a world where everything is contingent, because then, by definition, it all could easily have never existed

1. There are contingent things
2. Contingent things can cause other contingent things
3. But there can't only be contingent things, because that would mean that there's an infinite regress of contingency, and a possiblity that nothing might have existed
4. An infinite regress is impossible
5. So there must be at least one necessary thing, and that is God

Kalam Cosmological Argument
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Whatever begins to exist has a cause

Believing that something can something can pop into existence is more of a stretch that believing in magic, at least in magic you've got a hat and a magician. If something can come into being from nothing, then why do we not see it happening all the time? Everyday experience and scientific evidence confirm (1)

2. The universe began to exist

The 2nd law of thermodynamics tells us that the universe is slowly running out of usable energy. If the universe has been here forever, it would have run our of usable energy by now. The universe is expanding and sprang into being from a single point in the finite past. Any universe which has, on average, been expanding throughout its history cannot be eternal in the past, but must have an absolute beginning, this even applies to the multiverse if there is such a thing. (2)

3. Therefore the universe has a cause

if (1) and (2) is true, then (3) is true

The cause must then be:

- Spaceless
- Timeless
- Immaterial
- Powerful
