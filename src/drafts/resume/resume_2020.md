        <td>AI Engine</td>
        <td>Architected, programmed and lead a team to develop an AI Engine for the segmentation and classification of radiology images (MRI, CT) for use with existing hospital PACS systems. The AI Engine was integrated into several hospitals where the images were dynamically collected, predicted and pushed back into their PACS system.</td>

        <td>Biomind</td>
        <td>ML Optimisations/Deployment Framework</td>
        <td>Architect, program, and lead a team to develop internal tooling for ML development, model optimizations, model security, model management (dynamic loading and unloading), and model integration/deployment into AI Engine.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>Biomind</td>
        <td>Algorithm Pipeline Framework</td>
        <td>Designed and built a "Pipelining" framework that encourages algorithm design in a functional programming approach. The new pipeline approach allows for easy scaling using multithreading and increases code readability. Lead a team to refactor existing machine learning pre and post-processing code to the new pipeline framework while developing and optimizing many image processing pipelines</td>

        <td>Biomind</td>
        <td>CI/CD for AI Engine & ML Development Team</td>
        <td>Redesigned the DevOps CI/CD pipeline for the AI Engine and ML Development team using ansible and AWX. The pipeline involved the orchestration of servers located in multiple regions, synchronizing artifact stores across regions for faster and more reliable builds. Automated tests and reporting using AWX with Github webhooks.</td>

        <td>NUS</td>
        <td>Indoor Localization and Wireless Vital Signs Monitoring</td>
        <td>A smart hospital infrastructure that is able to locate patients and assets via BLE tags and wirelessly connect and handover connections to various wireless vital signs devices, allowing mobility for the patient. Worked as a lead programmer and systems architect involving embedded linux, backend services and databases, front-end web application and algorithms.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>NUS</td>
        <td>Tele-Rehabilitation System</td>
        <td>Worked on a Tele- rehabilitation project which would allow elderly and stroke patients to perform physiological exercises from home using inertial measurement units (IMUs). Designed the patient-side IOS application as well is embedded devices (IMUs) for use in a Tele-rehabilitation project.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>NUS</td>
        <td>Visual Stethoscope</td>
        <td>Designed an electronic attachment for stethoscopes which aggregates and displays cardio waveforms compactly. Custom made PCB for compact enclosure which was CNC'ed out of aluminium. Filtering was done in hardware while segmentation and clustering algorithms for outlier rejection was done in C.</td>

        <td>NUS</td>
        <td>Game Design and Experimental Setup for Research into Primate Spatial Neurons</td>
        <td>The experiment consists of 2 parts (virtual and actual). The virtual part is a game designed in Unity3D where a primate uses a joystick to navigate a maze to release rewards at certain locations while brain signals are being recorded. In the actual part, the monkey is mounted to an actual robot where he navigates an actual maze.</td>
