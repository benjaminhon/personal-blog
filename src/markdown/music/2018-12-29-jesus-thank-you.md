The mystery of the cross I cannot comprehend    
The agonies of Calvary    
You the perfect Holy One, crushed Your Son    
Who drank the bitter cup reserved for me    

Your blood has washed away my sin    
Jesus, thank You    
The Father’s wrath completely satisfied    
Jesus, thank You    
Once Your enemy, now seated at Your table    
Jesus, thank You    

By Your perfect sacrifice I’ve been brought near    
Your enemy You’ve made Your friend    
Pouring out the riches of Your glorious grace    
Your mercy and Your kindness know no end    

Lover of my soul    
I want to live for You    

Your blood has washed away my sin    
Jesus, thank You    
The Father’s wrath completely satisfied    
Jesus, thank You    
Your blood has washed away my sin    
Jesus, thank You    
The Father’s wrath completely satisfied    
Jesus, thank You    
Once Your enemy, now seated at Your table    
Jesus, thank You
