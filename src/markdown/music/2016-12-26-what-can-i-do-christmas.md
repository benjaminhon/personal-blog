From the high and Holy  
To a manger lowly  
The greatest mystery the world has ever known  
How You left Your majesty  
To embrace humanity  
It awes and humbles me  
To be loved by a God so high  

What can I do but thank You  
What can I do but give my life to You  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
What can I do but praise You  
Every day make ev'rything I do  
A hallelujah  
A hallelujah  
Hallelujah  

To the least and lowest  
You became as one with us  
In our grief and brokenness You suffered by our side  
From a cradle to the cross  
Rising up victorious  
The Messiah Jesus  
Born to us on that holy night
