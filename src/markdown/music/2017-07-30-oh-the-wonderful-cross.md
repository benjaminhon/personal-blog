When I survey the wondrous Cross   
On which the Prince of Glory died   
My richest gain, I count but loss   
And pour contempt on all my pride   

See from His head, His hands, His feet   
Sorrow and love flow mingled down   
Did ever such love and sorrow meet?   
Or thorns compose, so rich a crown   

Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross   
Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live   
Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross   
All who gather here by grace, draw near and bless Your name   

Were the whole realm of nature mine   
That were an offering far too small   
Love so amazing, so divine   
Demands my soul, my life, my all   

Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross   
Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live   
Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross   
All who gather here by grace, draw near and bless Your name   
Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross   
Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live   

Love so amazing, so divine   
Demands my soul, my life, my all
