“Behold the Lamb who bears our sins away,  
Slain for us - and we remember  
The promise made that all who come in faith  
Find forgiveness at the cross.  
So we share in this bread of life,  
And we drink of His sacrifice  
As a sign of our bonds of peace  
Around the table of the King.

The body of our Saviour Jesus Christ,  
Torn for you - eat and remember  
The wounds that heal, the death that brings us life  
Paid the price to make us one.  
So we share in this bread of life,  
And we drink of His sacrifice  
As a sign of our bonds of love  
Around the table of the King. 

The blood that cleanses every stain of sin,  
Shed for you - drink and remember  
He drained death’s cup that all may enter in  
To receive the life of God.  
So we share in this bread of life,  
And we drink of His sacrifice  
As a sign of our bonds of grace  
Around the table of the King. 

And so with thankfulness and faith we rise  
To respond, - and to remember  
Our call to follow in the steps of Christ  
As His body here on earth.  
As we share in His suffering  
We proclaim Christ will come again!  
And we’ll join in the feast of heaven  
Around the table of the King ”
