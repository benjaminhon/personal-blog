What grace is mine that He who dwells in endless light   
Called through the night to find my distant soul   
And from his scars poured mercy that would plead for me   
That I might live and in his name be known   
   
So I will go wherever He is calling me   
I lose my life to find my life in Him   
I give my all to gain the hope that never dies   
I bow my heart, take up my cross and follow Him   
   
What grace is mine to know His breath alive in me   
Beneath his wings my wakened soul may soar   
All fear can flee for deathâ€™s dark night is overcome   
My Saviour lives and reigns forevermore   
   
So I will go wherever He is calling me   
I lose my life to find my life in Him   
I give my all to gain the hope that never dies   
I bow my heart, take up my cross and follow Him
