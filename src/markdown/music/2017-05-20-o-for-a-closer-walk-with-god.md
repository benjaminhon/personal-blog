O for a closer walk with God   
A calm and heavenly frame   
A light to shine upon the road   
Leading to the Lamb   

Where is that blessedness I knew   
When first I saw the Lord   
Where is that soul refreshing view   
Of Jesus and His Word   

O fire of God come burn in me   
Renew a holy passion   
Til Christ my deepest longing be   
My never-failing fountain   
My never-failing fountain   

What peaceful hours I once enjoyed   
How sweet the memory still   
But they have left an aching void   
The world can never fill   

The dearest idol I have known   
Whateâ€™er that idol be   
Help me to tear it from Thy throne   
And worship only Thee   

So shall my walk be close with God   
Calm and serene my frame   
So purer light shall mark the road   
That leads me to the Lamb
