A rich young man came to ask of Christ  
Good teacher, will you tell me  
What must I do for eternal life  
I’ve kept your laws completely  
Sell all you have; give to the poor  
Then heaven’s treasure shall be yours  
How hard for those who are rich on earth  
To gain the wealth of heaven  

Now Jesus sat by the offering gate  
As people brought their money  
The rich they filled the collection plate  
The widow gave a penny  
Now she’s out-given all the rest  
Her gift was all that she possessed  
Not what you give but what you keep  
Is what the King is counting  
  
Oh teach me Lord to walk this road  
The road of simple living  
To be content with what I own   
And generous in giving  
And when I cling to what I have  
Please wrest it quickly from my grasp  
I’d rather lose all the things of earth  
To gain the things of heaven  

Yes, I’d rather lose all the things of earth  
To gain the things of heaven
