From the highest of heights to the the depths of the sea  
Creation revealing your majesty  
From the colors of fall to the fragrance of spring  
Every creature unique in the song that it sings  
All exclaiming  

Indescribable, uncontainable  
You place the stars in the sky and You know them by name  
You are amazing God  
All powerfull, untamable  
Awstruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim  
You are amazing God  

Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go  
Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow  
Who imagined the sun and gives source to its light  
Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night  
None can fathom  

Indescribable, uncontainable  
You place the stars in the sky and You know them by name  
You are amazing God  
All powerfull, untamable  
Awstruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim  
You are amazing God  

You are amazing God  
You are amazing God
