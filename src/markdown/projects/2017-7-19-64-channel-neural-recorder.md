## Date Completed
Sep 2010 – Sep 2011

## Description
Designed a 64 channel neural recording system for my graduating project. Achieved a sample time of 31250 Hz per channel using 64 single ended op-amps, 4 differential op-amps, 5 multiplexers and 1 CPLD. A unique multiplexing solution was used to mimic 64 instrumentation amplifiers, using only 4 differential op-amps instead of 64.
